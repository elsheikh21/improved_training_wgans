# Improved Training WGANs

- This is a Keras implementation for DCGANs model using 3 different methods
    1. Vanilla GAN loss
    2. Wasserstein GAN
    3. Wasserstein GAN - Gradient Penalizing
- To show difference between the above mentioned training loss functions, in terms of stability and speed of convergence
- Motivated by [Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00028.pdf)
